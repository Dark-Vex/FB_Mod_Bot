[OFFERING] 2BR/1BA in West Campus $865/mo. for ENTIRE UNIT (randomwordhere) (that's only $432.50 per room). Lease term is August 2014-2015. It isn't furnished, but I can leave a desk, some shelves, etc. for free if you'd like. This lease is for the entire unit, so you must have/find your own roommate. Utilities are not included, but it has free basic cable (with only one outlet, sadly). This will be an official lease sign-over through the complex. This is the cheapest place to live in West Campus with your own, private room. That's why I've lived there for the last 2 years. Location and price are amazing.
